### Useful resources

Firefox add-ons that I used to create a pixel perfect version of this website:
- [Pixel Perfect Pro](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pixel-perfect-pro/) - This helped me to display a screenshot on top of the webpage to easily check if dimensions were accurate.
- [PX: Viewport Dimensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/px-viewport-dimensions/) - This add-on will show you the dimensions of your viewport while resizing your browser.

Other tools:
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) - This helped me resize screenshots provided in the project
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This helped me create a rapid mockup to get dimensions of components.
